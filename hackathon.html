            In focusing on identity and reputation for our inaugural event, we
            are running a hackathon focused around the development of applications
            that use Urbit ID as the authentication and identity layer.
        </p>
        <p>
            For those who wish to participate, they need to provide two things:
        </p>
        <p>
            1. Join the Subassembly urbit group and request access to the hackathon chat.
        </p>
        <div class="button-group">
            <a
                href="https://tlon.network/lure/~sarlev-sarsen/subassembly"
                class="button"
                >join us on urbit ↗</a
            >
        </div>
        <p>
            2. Submit your application to the "hackathon submissions" collection as a url to clearweb website
            that uses Urbit ID as the authentication layer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond those two requirements, anything goes. You do not need to attend Subassembly in order to
            participate. That said, winners will be selected by the attendees of the Subassembly event and
            it's always helpful to be able to make your case to the judges. The top submissions will be
            awarded a prize of Urbit stars, courtesy of the Urbit Foundation.
        </p>
        <p>
            In support of using Urbit ID as the authentication layer, we have two toolsets available for your use:
        </p>
        <p>
            Azimake, from ~hanfel-dovned is a urbit desk that includes a built-in sign-in with metamask functionality
            that uses your urbit to serve a website and authenticate users.
        </p>
        <p>
            create-azimuth-app is a web2 native tool that allows you to create a website that uses urbit ID as the
            authentication layer. You can use this in conjunction with any other web2 tooling of your chosing to
            make your application.
