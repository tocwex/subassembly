        <p>
            In focusing on identity and reputation for our inaugural event, we
            are running a hackathon focused around the development of applications
            that use Urbit ID as the authentication and identity layer.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you wish to participate, you need to do two things:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Join the <a href="https://tlon.network/lure/~sarlev-sarsen/subassembly" class="inline-link">
                Subassembly Urbit group</a> and request access to the hackathon chat. After requesting to
                participate, you will be given access to the hackathon chat where you can ask questions, get help,
                and submit your work.
            </li>
            <li>
                Submit a link—by October 15th, 2024 at 11:59pm PST—to your Azimuth app to the "hackathon submissions" collection so that anyone can
                use their Urbit ID to authenticate and interact with your application.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Beyond those two requirements, anything goes. You do not need to attend Subassembly in order to
            participate and win. That said, applications will be judged by the attendees of the Subassembly event and
            it's always helpful to be able to make your case to the judges (link at the bottom of this page for the application to attend the event).
            The top submissions will be awarded a prize of Urbit stars, courtesy of the Urbit Foundation.
        </p>
        <p>
            In support of using Urbit ID as the authentication layer, we have two toolsets available for your use:
        </p>
        <p>
            <a class="inline-code">%azimake</a>, from <a href="https://network.urbit.org/~hanfel-dovned" class="inline-link">~hanfel-dovned</a>, is a urbit desk that includes a built-in sign-in with metamask functionality
            that uses your urbit to serve a website and authenticate users. To use this tool, you will need to have a
            running urbit ship that is accessible to the internet. Run <a class="inline-code">|install ~ridlyd %azimake</a> in your dojo to download
            the desk and follow the instructions in the desk to get started.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/shawntobin/create-azimuth-app/tree/main" class="inline-link">create-react-azimuth-app</a> is a web2
            native tool, created by <a href="https://network.urbit.org/~rolryx" class="inline-link">~rolryx</a> and the
            Urbit Foundation, that allows you to create a website that uses urbit ID as the authentication layer.
            You can use this in conjunction with any other web2 tooling of your chosing to make your application. To use it,
            make sure you have npm installed and run <a class="inline-code">npx create-react-azimuth-app my-app</a> to get started.
