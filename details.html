            Subassembly is an outgrowth of the
            <a href="https://assembly.urbit.org" class="inline-link"
                >Urbit Assembly</a
            >
            series, focused on a subset of the technical, cultural, and
            philosophical concepts that bring Urbit enthusiasts to the
            ecosystem.

        <p>
            For our inaugural event, Subassembly PNW, we are focusing on the
            topics of reputation, trust, and sovereign identity.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will be gathering in an intimate woodland venue, <a class="inline-link" href="https://wellspringspa.com/">The Wellspring Spa</a>, outside of the
            usual tendencies of the digital native, and limiting attendance to
            approximately fifty participants.*
        </p>
        <p>
            The event will be held from 3pm on Sunday, October 20th, through 11am on Tuesday, 0ctober 22nd.
        </p>
        <p>
