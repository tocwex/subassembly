                        The original, Borgesian metaphor of Urbit is about the
                        nature of representing reality; the map of Tlön unrolls
                        over the landscape. Urbit has always attracted those who
                        think deeply about new manifestations of reality, and
                        new realities which emerge from activity. We believe
                        that it’s time to make the coordination of reality a
                        major focus of Urbit. The early tools and primitives are
                        ready, and the timing is viciously elegant.

                        Legacy society is undergoing an accelerating migration
                        to the digital realm, which holds both the extremely
                        dangerous potential for a loss of long-held context and
                        values in the process of translation, and the promise of
                        building durable foundations of distributed
                        infrastructure that route around damage and resist
                        tyranny. Legacy institutions and maps of reality are
                        surrendering to a sclerosis which demands tools to allow
                        dramatically more agentic coordination; in order to free
                        capital, capacity, and trust loose from their rotting
                        bindings, and assemble them into functional organs of a
                        human-oriented digital civilization.

                    <p>
                        Urbit’s emphasis on simplicity and stability, its
                        radical lack of dependence on the legacy computing and
                        networking paradigm, and its high degree of control over
                        tools; provide us an unparalleled advantage in building
                        these foundational primitives. Every design decision,
                        down to the simplicity of the Nock instruction set,
                        reinforces these principles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Urbit’s future is to first represent the reality that
                        its owners, builders, and users deem worthy; to create a
                        life-size map of the world as we see it. Once these
                        pictures have been painted, via systems of reputation,
                        mutual verification, and data inputs from other levels
                        of reality; the unique architecture of the Urbit
                        network–simple personal servers, a widely distributed
                        PKI, a p2p routing protocol–allows for the composition
                        and autonomous rearrangement of any set of objects
                        represented on the network.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From there, Urbit identity, reputation, and
                        reality-mapping standards will allow us to take the
                        first steps towards full-scale, civilization-level
                        protocols.

                    <p>
                        Until recently, Urbit has mostly been focused on
                        tool-building, whether on the core development or
                        product side. Now, we see the first explorers and
                        track-layers using those tools to map the wilderness and
                        set up outposts and communication lines.

                        Azimuth is increasingly attracting attention as a
                        genuinely competitive entry in the self-sovereign ID
                        space, which has traditionally suffered from a paradox:
                        Sovereign ID needs to grow organically around
                        high-signal interactions of social, financial, and
                        technological import. The initial population of an ID
                        schema needs to be doing real things, trusting each
                        other, and building an initial trust graph that can
                        subsequently attract more participants. There have been
                        many attempts to build technically brilliant
                        decentralized ID systems that have crucially neglected
                        to attach themselves to a compelling use case. Urbit, as
                        a full-stack computer, with a decentralized networking
                        protocol attached, has perhaps the best “compelling use
                        case” one could imagine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are murmurings of multiple Urbit-native blockchain
                        projects which seek to use the sovereignty and
                        widespread distribution of Azimuth points as the basis
                        for an innately distributed and committed consensus
                        layer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Projects like %fund and Alphabet are creating open
                        protocols for p2p interaction on Urbit which create
                        their own flywheels of reputation data among users,
                        making the social graph of Urbit richer as time goes on;
                        eventually, they will eat chunks of the web2 social
                        graph whole as they endow ‘users’ with self-sovereign
                        Azimuth IDs. These protocols are fundamentally different
                        from the web2 platforms whose functions they replace;
                        they share basic understanding of key primitives, but
                        allow users to set community rules with a high degree of
                        flexibility both internally and inter-communally. Urbit
                        has sometimes been termed a ‘network of networks’, but
                        we’re only now seeing the second clause come to
                        fruition.

                    <p>
                        Urbit IDs (Azimuth points) can represent humans, network
                        nodes, AI agents, or physical devices. Urbit-native
                        blockchains can create a consensus layer. Protocols
                        built on Urbit create ever-deepening layers of opt-in
                        reputation data on top of Azimuth. Hardware hosting
                        options and Urbit-native crypto wallets make Urbit nodes
                        sovereign enough to maintain a diversity of perspectives
                        on reality. Integrations with other decentralized
                        protocols are bridges to other segments of reality and
                        graphs of trust and interaction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mapping reality is the first step. Urbit’s high-fidelity
                        network of nodes, tools, and protocols allow for novel,
                        endlessly composable and creative forms of coordination.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Urbit is a self-sovereign coordination primitive. Legacy
                        platforms and network architectures mandate one-to-many
                        or many-to-one; coordination is at the whim of the
                        chokepoint. As layer 1 blockchains are global consensus,
                        and L2s are local consensus, Urbit is an endlessly
                        flexible consensus-creation tool that can seamlessly
                        interface with the requisite level of legibility. This
                        is the missing piece needed to allow open protocols to
                        coordinate the resources of reality at a high enough
                        degree of fidelity to allow for organic,
                        incentive-driven replacement of brittle, centralized
                        legacy alternatives.

                        Social layers, marketplaces, knowledge production,
                        cultural flowering, property rights, and physical human
                        society must all find their digital accommodations with
                        this new representation of reality.

                    <p>
                        We believe that the time is ripe for Urbit to begin
                        conquering—using Azimuth, the first Urbit-based
                        protocols, and a universe of practical use cases—the
                        legacy informational, social, financial and physical
                        realities around us. The question in front of us is now
                        how we will do it.

                        We invite you to join us in the foothills of Mount

                        plan the representation of reality and the possibilities
                        of its coordination on the Urbit network.
